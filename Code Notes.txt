Starting from test.py
|_  Invoques test_syn_uni  or test_syn_mix
    Define 3 variables (sizes??) m=200, n=100, k=50
    K is a file number

test_syn_uni
funcion run_test_uni:
    p_unre_set and ldba_set, a for is applied to read the files, both are the
    names of the database
    ldba = average number of claims for each entity
    p = portion of unreliable sources
    invoques the function of run_syn_uni wiht the parameters:
        m: same 200 of the main program
        n: same 100 of the main program
        load: database load path
        save: empty
        ldba: for iteration index
        p_ure: for iteration index

function run_sys_uni:
    executes the KDE algorithm and also with the baseline methods
    and call the function reload_data

Dataset meaning
object = entities = n
source_id 200 = m
value = reliability score
1.0:1.0 = ground-truthed opinion or trustworthy opinion
second value us confidences of a representative value, measure the significance
level of the representative value of an opinion
